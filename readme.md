# Momentum ranking algorithm
A performance oriented algorithm to rank items based on their momentary parametric relevance, suitable for social network feeds, real-time curated timelines, e-commerce relevance listings or other momentum-based data analysis.

Attains high performance even in databases with very big number of items, and is optimized to keep ranks relevantly up-to-date, to present relevance-ranked item lists that react close to real-time.
