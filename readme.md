# Momentum ranking algorithm
A performance oriented algorithm to rank items in a set based on their momentary relevance.

Suitable for applications where a set of items must be shown in order of current parametric relevance like social network feeds, automatically curated timelines of posts, realtime e-commerce products relevance in search results or any other kind of realtime tracking of items' momentum-based relevance.

Attains high performance even in databases with very big number of items, and is optimized to keep ranks relevantly up-to-date, to present relevance-ranked item lists that react close to real-time.
